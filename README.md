# Geode Loopless
## Type Enforced Primitive Recursive Functions (and Sets)

### Description

Geode Loopless (GeodeL) is a Domain Specific Language that aims at facilitating the writing and analysis of Primitive Recursive Functions and Sets.

This DSL is embedded in Scala, and aims to use it's strong type system to enforce the arity and type of the PrimRec functions and sets, thus ensuring any function or set is really primitive recursive.
